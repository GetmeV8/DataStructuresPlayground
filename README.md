# DataStructuresPlayground
Welcome to my JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms Playground! This repository is a comprehensive collection of implementations for various data structures like arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, graphs, tries, along with a wide range of sorting and searching algorithms.

Contents:

Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and more.
Searching Algorithms:

Binary Search, Linear Search, Exponential Search, and more.
Data Structures:

Arrays, Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, Graphs, Trees, Heaps, Hash Tables, and Tries.
Challenges:

Exciting array-related problems to solve and practice your algorithmic skills.
Feel free to explore, contribute, and use these implementations as a learning resource. Let's dive deep into the world of JavaScript, Data Structures, and Algorithms!

Happy Coding!
